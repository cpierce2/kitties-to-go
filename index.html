                <p class="main-p">Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or knees and purrs you to sleep. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick 
                    paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then <span style="color: #2ca5cc;">retire to the warmest spot</span> on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking 
                    a catnap attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what’s your problem? I meant to do that 
                    now I shall wash myself intently cough and swat at dog.
                </p>

                <p class="main-p">Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) fooled again thinking the dog likes me. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs 
                    at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner and always hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.
