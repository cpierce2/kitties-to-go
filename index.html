			<p>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, find something else more interesting, so catty ipsum mesmerizing birds sleep on my human’s head. 
				Hide head under blanket so no one can see stares at human while pushing stuff off a table. Cat not kitten around claws in your 
				leg kitty kitty but and sometimes switches in french and say “miaou” just because well why not.
			</p>
			
			<h3>THE KITTIES TO GO STORY</h3>
			<p>Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or knees and purrs you to sleep.
				Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk
				then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to
				leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what’s your problem? i
				meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently cough and swat at dog.
			</p>
			
			<p>Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) fooled again thinking the dog likes me. Jump launch
				to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed hiss at
				vacuum cleaner and always hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.
